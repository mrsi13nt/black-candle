1- you need to open your terminal whatever your OS
2- then make sure you installed python3 if you didn't you can check this link to download ("linkre")
3- write this command (pip3 install -r requirements.txt) to install the python packages (it's important)
4- you can use the tool now if we finished, so i am gonna explain every single command in this tool :)

* the main command of using this tool is python3 black_candle.py "then after that you have to put the switches"
 and one more thing you can run the tool if you didn't input URL or list file of URLs.
 so to do that for single url write -u or --url the after that write the URL but i recommend for you to write the URL between qoutes like this "" or this ''
 for the file do the same but you need to change the switch to -l or --list and then follow the same steps
--------------
now we finished the first steps and i am gonna explain that other switches

first SQLi (SQL injection)
this vulnerability attacks the weakness parmeters in the SQL database and it's high severity or medium
for more info check this link (https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)
and more about blind SQLi (https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind)



* SQLi scanner will run automatically when you input the url with data or the url with payload

now how we can use data or payload and what they do!
- data is specific parameter you want to scan like "id=2" this is exactly what you will write after switch --data
- payload it's option make you have a choice to put custom payload you want to scan
= by the way you can use both of switches at the same command line :)

* Host header injection scanner 
you can read more about Host header injections here ("linkre")

to use it you need to write -hh it's only run the scanner on the url that you input and it will runs with default options
but if you choose to add custom host website you can do like that (e.g. --host "www.ping.com") with --host switch


* Javascript scanner :)
it's maybe new to hear about it but it's good for you
we build this function or scanner to scan all javescript files in the website so it first crwalling for Javascript files in all the website and then it scan it for some tokens or API keys
have fun in using it :)

* XSS scanner 
it's most popular vulnerabilityin web but we are in this tool only scan for Reflected and DOM and Blind XSS 

i am gonna explain this shortliy, if you wanted to scan Reflected or DOM or Blind XSS you just need to input the URL and then the type of scanner.
Reflected => -rf
DOM => -d
Blind => -b

== but one more important thing you should do before run blind XSS scan go to this link ("linkre") and register on it and take a link to scan for blind xss and after scanner finish that web site gonna tell you what is payload runs in the target website

and after you get the link go to config.py file and search for <custom.subdomain> and replace it with that domain you got from the website
